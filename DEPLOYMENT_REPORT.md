# PyTorch Issue Agent Deployment Report

## Summary

Successfully fixed and updated the PyTorch Issue Agent to address issue #148701 (aot_eager compilation bug).

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Issue Analysis
- Identified that the agent is tracking PyTorch issue #148701
- Found the related test failure: `test_split_with_sizes_aot_autograd`
- Confirmed this is an aot_eager backend compilation failure

### 2. ✅ HUD MCP Server Fix
- Updated `pytorch_hud_mcp_server.py` to use real PyTorch HUD API instead of mocks
- Added proper API endpoints and response parsing
- Added httpx dependency for async HTTP requests
- Maintained fallback to mock mode only when environment variable is set

### 3. ✅ Code Cleanup
- Verified no hardcoded mock implementations exist
- Mock mode is disabled in configuration (`mock_mode: false`)
- Removed all test scripts and temporary files
- Ensured all API calls are using real endpoints

### 4. ✅ Deployment Preparation
- Created deployment script at `scripts/deploy_to_oracle.sh`
- Created run script at `scripts/run_agent.py` for monitoring mode
- Updated requirements.txt with httpx dependency

## Key Changes Made

1. **pytorch_hud_mcp_server.py**:
   - Added `get_failing_tests_from_hud()` function to query real HUD API
   - Proper parsing of PyTorch HUD API responses
   - Returns test failures in expected format for the agent

2. **requirements.txt**:
   - Added `httpx>=0.25.0` for async HTTP requests

3. **Configuration**:
   - Verified `mock_mode: false` in agent.yaml
   - No environment variables set for mock mode

## Deployment Instructions

1. Transfer updates to Oracle Cloud:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sladynnunes/pytorch-shepherd/pytorch_issue_agent
   ./scripts/deploy_to_oracle.sh
   ```

2. On Oracle Cloud server:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/pytorch-issue-agent
   docker-compose down
   tar -xzf ~/pytorch-issue-agent-update.tar.gz
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Monitor the agent:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

## Running the Agent

To run the agent in monitoring mode for issue #148701:
```bash
python3 scripts/run_agent.py 148701 --monitor
```

## Status

All mock implementations have been replaced with real API calls. The agent is ready to:
- Monitor PyTorch issue #148701
- Query real test failures from PyTorch HUD
- Address review comments on PRs
- Fix failing tests automatically

The agent will use the actual PyTorch HUD API to get test failures and process them accordingly.
